`contents/`, `source/`, `public/` declare where everyone goes to edit/view the website. Coders go for __source__, Authors go for __contents__ to write and both can publish whatever ends up in the __public__.

Focus on Content
----------------

Just keep editing your content through your favorite markdown editor. Save and instantly see the result in your browser window, with all the bell and whistles of a full fledged/styled Website.

Press a button, publish changes online!

Focus on Code
-------------

You maintain the website, so you want to have an easy life. Webseiten separates your Code (HTML, CSS, JS) from the content, mostly written in Markdown.

For previewing you can pull in the latest contents/code vice versa.

Fixing CSS-Glitches, JS-Bugs and HTML-Mess without corrupting any of the content. Agree on versioning that is understandable for endusers.

1. If you fix bugs, it will not interfere with any content written.
2. If you add features, they will be available from now on, but it will not break existing content
3. If you rewrite everything, content will break, so your users have to migrate to your new structur.
